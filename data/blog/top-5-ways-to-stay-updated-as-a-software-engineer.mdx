I primarily do frontend engineering so my recommendations could be a little biased. That said, I would recommend you to check them out even if you do backend.

### Agney Menon

This is a newsletter from a senior of mine. I didn’t know about him or the newsletter until a few months back but ever since then I am glad I found this. It encompasses major events in the industry. He tests out different libraries as well and gives out his reviews. He puts out an email every month and the previous ones are archived as well. If I could only recommend a single source for you, this would be my recommendation.

### Fireship

He puts out short 100 second videos that are nuggets. You would need to know a little bit of programming in general before you start watching his videos so I wouldn't be recommending this to absolute beginners. He also comes up with [Code Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJUl3OAIT0k&list=PL0vfts4VzfNjnYhJMfTulea5McZbQLM7G&index=1) that lets you in on anything huge that happens in the industry. He has a secondary channel [Beyond Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Xd-TjJByJyK2w1zNwY0zQ) that's worth checking out as well.

### Theo Brown

At first I thought this was some pretentious douchebag shitting on JS but turns out he is an amazing engineer as well as CEO at ping.gg. He also created the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) which is gaining popularity as we speak. He gives out his thoughts on different events happening in the industry and also helps out younger engineers like me by sharing insights on how to get better and get to the next level. He also streams on twitch but those are 1 hour+ and I can’t watch a guy rant for that long. But he splits these streams up into different videos and they are amazing content. I would recommend his content for folks that are comfortable enough to enjoy [Fireship.io](http://Fireship.io)

### Mehul Mohan

He is another solid engineer and CEO. The channel is gold. He puts out videos on software engineering and the company focuses on educating aspiring engineers. His thoughts are well articulated and I can recommend the channel even to an absolute beginner unlike Theo. He shares his take on everything engineering.

### Daily Dev

This is an amazing site which puts together various blogs that are trending on different platforms and gives you an amazing feed of blogs. Quick warning, this can be a little addictive and you might start going through stupid rabbit holes so proceed with caution. It comes with a chrome extension that loads the feed when you open a new tab but I had it disabled for that reason.
