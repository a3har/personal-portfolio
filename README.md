# a3har.com

This is my personal website. Here I write blogs, add code snippets, code live demos, and add resources for everybody else to look refer.

The application is built with **Next.js/React/MDX**

## Overview

- `pages/api/*` - API routes for the [`Dashboard`](https://a3har.com/dashboard). Contains Twitter, Spotify, and Google Analytics APIs.

- `pages/resources` - [Resources](https://a3har.com/resources) page

- `pages/tweets` - my favourite [Tweets](https://a3har.com/tweets) from the twitter world.

- `pages/*` - All other static pages.

## Installation

```bash

git clone https://github.com/a3har/personal-portfolio.git

### Running locally

To run the project locally, create a `.env.local` file and add the required API credentials there. Reference [`.env.example`](https://github.com/a3har/personal-portfolio/blob/master/.env.example) from the source for the list of API keys required.
